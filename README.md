# TicTacToe_MileStone1
Complete Python Bootcamp: Go from zero to hero in python 3 (Udemy online course)
This game is called Tic Tac Toe
this is my very first python project which I had to built up from scratch.
Therefore I took a look on walk-through steps (but not the complete walk through ;) )
This helped me to have an idea of how should I think throughout this project.
However I stayed genuine in my coding and way of thinking.
